README should explain what the code is about and how to compile and run it.

Avoid implementing everything inside the main.cpp.

You should split the implementation of different strategies for the computation of the learning rate into different functions instead of commenting the lines.
I would have expected you to read the optimization parameters from file and to implement the third strategy for the computation of the learning rate.

The results are correct.
